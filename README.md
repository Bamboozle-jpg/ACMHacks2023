TO BEGIN:
- Edit `MainPage.jsx` at `src/pages/MainPage.jsx`
- Edit both other JSX files at the `pages` directory
- The way to edit React JSX (JavaScript Extended) files is to simply write HTML

### Notes about ReactJS
- The way React works is that each file exports HTML
- Each component or individual page can have a JSX file (JavaScript extended with HTML for exporting)
